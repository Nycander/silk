# Modularisation

## Bundles
A set of `Bindings` is described by a tree structure composed of `Bundle`s as nodes and `Module`s as leafs. 
The role of a `Bundle` is to describe a subset of child bundles and modules in its only method called `bootstrap`. 
When `install`-ing a `Bundle` is always referred statically by its `class` instance. 
This comes as no surprise when knowing that the bootstrapping is a _static_ process that just happens once.

Inheritance should just be used to provide helper methods.
As soon as the `bootstrap` method is implemented to `install` or `uninstall` bundles or modules no further 
inheritance should occur. For such purposes always use composition. Hence split into 2 separate bundles and
install them both.

The below example show a typical case where the `BootstrapperBundle` class is utilised to install a child bundle:
{% highlight java %}
protected void bootstrap() {
	install(ChildBundle.class);
}
{% endhighlight %}

### The Root Bundle
All `Bundle`-trees need a single root node that is the entrance point for the `Bootstrapper` when visiting 
the tree structure. 

### <a id="uninstall"></a> Uninstalling Bundles and Modules
Overrides are hard to understand and maintain. Therefore there are no overrides at all. 
You cannot override bindings, bundles or modules because this soon or later ends up in a mess.

If dividing into bundles or modules that you can compose more flexible doesn't feel appropriate or isn't possible since it is not part of your source you can `uninstall` `Bundle`s or `Module`s.
Once a bundle or module has been uninstalled it cannot be reinstalled again. Every uninstalled component will definitely not be bootstrapped including all children and grant-children of a uninstalled bundle.
But it is very well possible that another bundle installs one of the children or grant-children. Of cause that child will be bootstrapped since there is a path in the tree of installed bundles that reaches it.  

To summarise it: Each `Bundle` has one of the below three states during the bootstrapping process:

* _installed_ (could be uninstalled later on)
* _uninstalled_ (cannot be installed any further)
* _not installed_ (but could be installed later on)

### Cross-Dependent or Cyclic Bundles
Bundles can be seen as static descriptions. Therefore the `Bootstrapper` can assume that each call
of a `Bundle`s `bootstrap(Bootstrapper)` method will produce the same result (calls on the `Bootstrapper`). 
Thereby it is not necessary to redo any `install` call for the same bundle. The effect is already covered after doing it once. 

**The static nature of bundles allows them to have any graph of references between each other.**

Bundles can (e.g.):

* be cross dependent on each other (A installs B, B installs A)
* have cycles (A installs B, B installs C, C installs A)
* ...whatever you can think of...

For a user of Silk this means: You don't have to care at all about the structure (graph) of bundles. There will be no problem with it!
